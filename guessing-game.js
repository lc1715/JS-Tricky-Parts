// **Guessing Game**
// Write a function calledÂ *** guessingGame *** which returns a function that allows 
//you to guess a random whole number between 0 and 99. Every time you create a new game, 
// it should select a * new* random number, and keep it secret from the player.
// Once the game has started, you can guess the number. The game should tell you 
//whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
// After a correct guess, the game ends.

function guessingGame() {
    let target = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
    let count = 0;
    let gameOver = false;

    return function guessTarget(num) {
        if (gameOver === true) {
            return "The game is over, you already won!";
        } else if (num < target) {
            count++;
            return `${num} is too low!`;
        } else if (num > target) {
            count++;
